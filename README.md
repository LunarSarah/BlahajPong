# BlahajPong

Ever wanted to play pong with your favorite shark, Blahaj, as the ball? Well now you can with BlahajPong! Simply move your left and right arrows to defend your goal and yeet the Blahaj into the opponents goal!

## Inspiration: 
I've always loved retro arcade/video games, and for SharkHacks 3 I wanted to give Blahaj the appreciation it deserves. Thus, the idea of BlahajPong was born. 

## What it does:

BlahajPong is a Blahaj themed recreation of the 1972 arcade game Pong, which was made by Atari! (Fun fact: It's not actually the first video game, contrary to popular belief! That title goes to the 1958 video game Tennis for Two.) 

## How I built it:
I built the game using JavaScript! I built the website with HTML and CSS.

## Challenges I ran into:
Due to the fact of me being new to the language of JavaScript and still learning it as well, I ran into a considerable amount of challenges that I was able to overcome with the help of Google and my friends from BlahajGang Adam and Tiffany (THANKS FOR YOUR HELP GUYS <3).

An example of a problem I ran into was when I was trying to figure out how to make the ball for Pong become a Blahaj. After Tiffany and Adam trying to come up with possible solutions Tiffany found one and explained it to me so I was able to code it while understanding it since I can have problems with comprehending things I find on the internet. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of: 
Other than the fact that I was able to overcome a lot of challenges from being new to the language, this is the first hackathon project I was actually able to fully complete within the time slot, so I'm really proud of myself for that. :D

## What I learned: 
I learned a ton of JavaScript including but not limited to how to work with images, basic API, and basic basic things for the language. 

## What's next for BlahajPong: 
I plan to add a scoring system in the future and a better website layout, although I do like the custom background I made. B)
